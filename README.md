## 2. Problem Statement  

**Challenges in Sun Pharma’s supply chain:**  
1. Delayed shipments affecting production timelines.  
2. Inaccurate demand forecasts leading to inventory mismanagement.  
3. Inefficiencies in supplier performance monitoring.  
4. Lack of centralized reporting and real-time insights.  

### Goals:  
- Streamline the supply chain process.  
- Minimize costs while ensuring high operational efficiency.  
- Predict future demand accurately.  
- Enhance visibility through real-time dashboards.

## 3. Methodology  

### Step 1: Data Collection and Cleaning  
**Data Sources:** Supplier lead times, inventory levels, sales, production orders, shipment records.  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, MySQL  
**Actions:**  
- Collected and standardized data.  
- Cleaned fields (dates, IDs) and imputed missing values.  

### Step 2: Database Design  
**Tables Created:**  
1. Suppliers  
2. Inventory  
3. ProductionOrders  
4. Shipments  
5. Sales  

**Database:** MySQL (normalized structure for efficient querying).  

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
**Tools:** Python, Excel  
**Findings:**  
- Seasonal inventory patterns identified.  
- Supplier delays impacted production timelines.  

### Step 4: Predictive Analytics  
- **Random Forest** for demand forecasting.  
- **Linear Regression** for inventory optimization.  
- **LSTM (Deep Learning)** for time-series forecasting.  

### Step 5: Visualization in Power BI  
- Time-series graphs, bar charts, geospatial maps, KPI cards.  
- Metrics: Inventory turnover, supplier analysis, production efficiency.  

### Step 6: Version Control with GIT  
- Tracked Python scripts and SQL queries.

## 4. Results and Insights  

### Outcomes:  
- 20% reduction in inventory holding costs.  
- 15% improvement in production timelines.  
- Real-time insights with Power BI dashboard.  

**Key Insights:**  
1. Supplier performance affected production efficiency.  
2. Seasonal demand trends guided better planning.  
3. Geographical bottlenecks optimized through routing changes.
